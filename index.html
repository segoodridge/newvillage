                    The <em>strong</em> element is for content that is of "strong importance," including things of great seriousness or urgency (such as warnings). This could be a sentence that is of great importance to the whole page, or you could merely try to point out that some words are of greater importance compared to nearby content.
                    <br>
                    Typically this element is rendered by default using a bold font weight. However, it should not be used to apply bold styling; use the CSS font-weight property for that purpose. Use the <em>b</em> element to draw attention to certain text without indicating a higher level of importance. Use the <em>em</em> element to mark text that has stress emphasis.
                    <br>    
                    Another accepted use for <em>strong</em> is to denote the labels of paragraphs which represent notes or warnings within the text of a page.
                </p>
                    <h4><em>b</em> vs. <em>strong</em></h4>
                <p>
                    It is often confusing to new developers why there are so many ways to express the same thing on a rendered website. <em>b</em> and <em>strong</em> are perhaps one of the most common sources of confusion, causing developers to ask "Should I use <em>b</em> or <em>strong</em> Don't they both do the same thing?"
                    <br>
                    Not exactly. The <em>strong</em> element is for content that is of greater importance, while the <em>b</em> element is used to draw attention to text without indicating that it's more important.
                    <br>
                    It may help to realize that both are valid and semantic elements in HTML and that it's a coincidence that they both have the same default styling (boldface) in most browsers (although some older browsers actually underline <em>strong</em> ). Each element is meant to be used in certain types of scenarios, and if you want to bold text for decoration, you should instead actually use the CSS font-weight property.
                    <br>
                    The intended meaning or purpose of the enclosed text should be what determines which element you use. Communicating meaning is what semantics are all about.
                    </p>
                    <h4><em>em</em> vs. <em>strong</em></h4>
                <p>
                    Adding to the confusion is the fact that while HTML 4 defined <em>strong</em> as indicating a stronger emphasis, HTML 5 defines <em>strong</em> as representing "strong importance for its contents." This is an important distinction to make.
                    <br>
                    While <em>em</em> is used to change the meaning of a sentence as spoken emphasis does ("I <em>love</em> carrots" vs. "I love <em>carrots</em>"), <em>strong</em> is used to give portions of a sentence added importance (e.g., "Warning! This is very dangerous.") Both <em>strong</em> and <em>em</em> can be nested to increase the relative degree of importance or stress emphasis, respectively.
